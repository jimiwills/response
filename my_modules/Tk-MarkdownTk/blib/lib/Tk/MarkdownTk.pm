=head1 NAME

Tk::MarkdownTk - a Tk::Markdown with tk widget tag support

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.06

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.06';

use base qw(Tk::Derived Tk::Markdown);
Construct Tk::Widget 'MarkdownTk';






=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Tk;
	use Tk::MarkdownTk;

	my $mw = new MainWindow();
    my $mdt = $mw->MarkdownTk();

	$mdt->insert(q{
		some markdown here

		with tags like this: <Tk::Button -text="Click me!">
	});

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 insert

Whenever insert is called on the MarkdownTk, 
some translation is done on the text in order to
diplay it nicely as markdown.  Tables are reformatted
(if the line starts with a bar) and headers are
tagged with different fonts.

This module is currently under development and
there's plenty to do, e.g. links, images, etc.

In MarkdownTk, html-ish tags are also transformed
into Tk widgets.

=cut


sub insert
{
  my ($self,$index,$content) = @_;
  my $res = $self->SUPER::insert($index,Tk::Markdown::FormatMarkdown($content));
  if(! $self->{inserting}){ ### don't allow recursion...
    $self->{inserting} = 1;
    $self->PaintMarkdown();
    $self->TransformTk();
    $self->see("1.0");
    $self->{inserting} = 0;
  }
  return $res;
}

=head2 TransformTk

This is called internally.  It parses out HTML-like tags that define Widgets to be drawn
in the text.

eg

	<Tk::Button -text="Click Me">

Also, perl can be run from the document... a Tk::Markdown allows <% %> which
is run prior to insertion (good for formatting) but Tk::MarkdownTk adds running
perl from <? ?>, which gets replaced inline, after insertion.  This is good for
adding named subs in the same namespace as the buttons and other tk widgets
added to the text area.  Eg:

	<Tk::Button -text="Click me" -command="run_this">
	<? sub run_this { print "Hello, world!\n"; } ?>

So remember:
	
	% formatted
	
	? subs


=cut

### look for <tags> (the other kind of tags) to be tranformed into actual widgets
sub TransformTk {
  my $self = shift;
  ### this is to find <tk::widget attributes>, or <? ?> script.
  my $re = qr/<Tk\:\:\w+[^>]*>|<\?.*?\?>/s;
  $self->FindAll('-regexp','-case', $re);
  my @i = $self->tagRanges('sel');
  #print map {"$_\n"} @i;
  for(my $i = @i-2; $i >= 0; $i-=2){
    my ($s,$e) = ($i[$i], $i[$i+1]);
    my $string = $self->get($s,$e);
    if($string =~ /<Tk\:\:(\w+)(.*)>/){
      my ($w,$a) = ($1,$2);
      my %a = parseAttrs($a);
      $self->delete($s,$e);
      my $t = $self->$w(%a);
      $self->windowCreate($s,-window=>$t);
    }
    elsif($string =~ /<\?=(.*)\?>/s){
      my $sub;
      eval("\$sub = sub { $1 }");
      die "$@ - somewhere in: $1" if $@;
      $self->delete($s,$e);
      $self->insert($s,&$sub());
    }
    elsif($string =~ /<\?(.*)\?>/s){
      $self->delete($s,$e);
      eval("$1");
      die "$@ - somewhere in: $1" if $@;
      die $@ if $@;
    }
  }
}

=head2 parseAttrs

A helper function for TransformTk.

=cut

### parse some attributes
sub parseAttrs {
  my ($attrs) = @_;
  my %attrs = ();
  while($attrs =~ /\G.*?([\w-]+)(=""|=''|=".*?[^\\]"|='.*?[^\\]'|=[^"']\S*|)/g){
    my ($k,$v) = ($1,$2);
    $v ||= 1;
    $v =~ s/^=//;
    $v =~ s/^(["'])(.*)\1$/$2/;
    if($k =~ /^-(?:command)$/){
      eval(" \$v = sub { $v }; ");
      die "$@ - somewhere in: $v" if $@;
      #print "COMMAND: $v\n";
    }
    $attrs{$k} = $v;
  }
  return %attrs;
}


=head2 clipEvents

This copied directly from Tk::ROText

=cut

sub clipEvents
{
  return qw[Copy];
}

=head2 ClassInit

This is copied directly from Tk::ROText.

=cut

sub ClassInit
{
  my ($class,$mw) = @_;
  my $val = $class->bindRdOnly($mw);
  my $cb = $mw->bind($class,'<Next>');
  $mw->bind($class,'<space>',$cb) if (defined $cb);
  $cb = $mw->bind($class,'<Prior>');
  $mw->bind($class,'<BackSpace>', $cb) if (defined $cb);
  $class->clipboardOperations($mw,'Copy');
  return $val;
}

=head2 Populate

This is copied and modified from Tk::ROText.  The modification is the addition
of a call to setDefaultStyles.  That's all.

=cut

sub Populate
{
  my ($self,$args) = @_;
  $self->SUPER::Populate($args);
}


=head2 Tk::Widget::ScrlMarkdownTk

Copied and adapted from Tk::ROText

=cut

sub Tk::Widget::ScrlMarkdownTk { shift->Scrolled('MarkdownTk' => @_) }
