Test data can be based on the following...

Topo2alpha = P11388
Topo2beta1 = Q02880
Topo2beta2 = Q92547
Cenp-F     = P49454
ER         = P03372
PKC iota   = P41743
PKC delta  = Q05655

Topos give lots of peptides, and shared too.  
Cenp-F and ER give many peptides over all, but mostly 0, 1 or 2 in each experiment.
PKC iota and delta have a good variety of measurements.
