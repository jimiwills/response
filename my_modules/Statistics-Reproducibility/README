Statistics-Reproducibility


This module facilitates investigation of reproducbility between multiple replicates of
quantitative experiments e.g. SILAC or microarray.  Scatter plots are great, but
only 2d.  Some people use correlation as a proxy for reproducibility, but it's not right.
This module helps you through the following items...

1) Summarize reproducibility across the replicates
2) Pick out replicates that agree more or less
3) Summarize reproducibility for individual proteins/genes/whatever
4) Set a cutoff for what you can call significant, based on precision
5) Deal with missing values (common in SILAC)
