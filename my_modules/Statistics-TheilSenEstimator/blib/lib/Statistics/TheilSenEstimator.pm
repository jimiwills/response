Statistics::TheilSen - Perl implementation of Theil Sen Estimator

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is a perl implementation of the Theil Sen Estimator, which is a method of
linear regression that uses medians.  All of the gradients of the lines between
all points are calculated, and hte median is the one reported.  Sounds trivial.  
If you have 1000s of points, then you have millions of lines, and sort-based
median methods can take ages, so Statistics::TheilSen uses the partition-based
Statistics::QuickMedian.

    # OOP...
    
    use Statistics::TheilSenEstimator;

    my $tse = Statistics::TheilSenEstimator->new(\$y_values, \$x_values);
    # which is really a shortcut for:
    my $tse = Statistics::TheilSenEstimator->new();
    $tse->addData(\@y_values, \@x_values); # listrefs of numeric scalars
    
    my $status_line = $tse->run(); # might tell if you had bad values, etc
    print "y = ", $tse->m(), "x + ", $tse->c(); # y = mx + c
    
    # or procedural...

Accepts two list refs, the lists should be the same length.  They represent y and x series
which will be the subject of the regression.  Returns a list of two
