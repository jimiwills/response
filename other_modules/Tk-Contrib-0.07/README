  For v0.03 it was reported that the modules build, test, and
  install (and the demo worked)

	perl5.004_54/Tk402.003
		SPARC/Solaris 2.5.1/Sun Compiler
	perl5.004_04/Tk402.003
		Digital Unix V4.0b, DEC CC compiler


HISTORY:

  Version 0.07 tobe

	o modules are now strict clean
	o Some tweaks to POD so it's more in Tk800 style
	o adapted Tks create.t test as 00basic.t
	o Changed -x/ymax fallback value from undef to 100.
	  so $parent->Axis() without arguments works without
	  croaking

	  
  Version 0.06

	o Axis: new -tickfont option. Patch send by
          Phiroze Parakh <phiroze@eecs.umich.edu>
	o Axis: options listed in SYNOPSIS section

  Version 0.0501

	o Dial.pm: Oooops package was Dial not Tk::Dial as it should.
	  Now CPAN indexer can get it right. Thanks to Andreas Koenig.

  Version 0.05

	o patch of TiedListbox to fix scrolling

		From: Andrew Allen <ada@hpesada.fc.hp.com>
		Subject: Re: Database -> TiedListbox widget
		Date: Fri, 12 Dec 1997 09:45:47 -0700
		Message-id: <199712121645.JAA22936@hpesada.fc.hp.com>

  Version 0.04

	o Typos fixed in README (Larry Virden <lvirden@cas.org>)

	o Many little documentation fixes (Larry Virden <lvirden@cas.org>)

	o (Mis)use Revision keyword of prcs for $VERSION.  '+1' offset
	  necessary to get a new $VERSION higher than 2.00x that was set
	  earlier by perforce.	

	o README: Added simple success reports table for this distribution

  Version 0.03

	o now flat subdirectory structure

	o demos/tiedlistbox strict and -w clean

  Version 0.02

	o added trivial tests: may only uncover possible -w warnings

	o Each contribution has it's own dir that a ready CPAN dist
	  after

		# add README file
		echo 'Makefile$' > MANIFEST.SKIP
		mkdir t && 
		perl Makefile.PL
		make manifest
		make dist

	  Blech!  Better remove subdir overhead and write a CPAN HOWTO

	o MM NAME attr set to Tk::Whatever => better perllocal.pod
	  entry but creates unnecessary auto/Tk/Whatever/.packlist

	
	o Removed FileDialog and WaitBox. They have their
	  own CPAN distribution already

	o Removed book-examples and TickerTape. They are not
	  widgets

  Version 0.01:

	o Contrib tree from Tk402.003
