I submit these widgets to the Perl community in the hope that someone
other than myself will find them useful. I have placed POD documentation
within as many as I could, time permitting, and those that do not have
adequate documentation will do eventually. The example programs should
show adequate usage profiles, though.

Requirements :-

        Tk              - 800.005 or above
        Tk::TiedListbox - by Andrew Allen <ada@fc.hp.com>
        Tk::Pane        - by Graham Barr <gbarr@pobox.com>

The suite is built/installed in the conventional manner :-

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install

The public classes are :-


        Tk::CheckBox    - A radio button style widget that uses a
                          check mark in a box. Useful as a boolean field.

        Tk::Columns     - A multicolumn list widget with resizeable borders
                          and sorting by column.

        Tk::ComboEntry  - A Drop down listbox + entry widget with nice keyboard
                          equivalent behaviour

        Tk::IconCanvas  - A canvas implementing a moveable iconic interface.
                          Allows attaching menus to icons and to background.

        Tk::SplitFrame  - A sliding separator for two child widgets. Allows either
                          horizontal or vertical separation between the two widgets.
                          Can work in concert as horizontal inside vertical or
                          vice-versa.

        Tk::TabFrame    - A tabbed frame geometry manager (like NoteBook).

        Tk::DockFrame   - A dockable widget management widget hierarchy.

        Tk::CornerBox   - A textured window resizing widget (like in Win95)

        Tk::Signals     - A publish and subscribe object signalling method like
                          that found in QT. Very useful when widgets that are not
                          in the same hierarchy need to alert each other to various
                          application level events.

    ################################################################
    # I consider the following widgets ready for use but having    #
    # behaviour that I would personally like to rewrite. I believe #
    # them to be relatively bug-free and invite you to try them out#
    ################################################################

        Tk::TabbedForm  - An extended TabFrame, allowing managed subwidgets used
                          as entry fields. Each field widget is given a 'set'
                          and a 'get' method to provide widget independent
                          methods of maintaining and querying data. The form
                          will pass back a hash of all field values on request.

        Tk::TableEdit   - A compound widget built from the TabbedForm, SplitFrame,
                          and Column widgets. It implements a simplified interface
                          to a flat file database. Try out the demo.

        Tk::Menustrip   - My own menu bar. Nothing special, though.

The private classes are :-

        Tk:ChildNotification - A kludge that some of the widgets use to get
                           alerted when a child widget is created. It
                           reimplements a method in Widget.pm and Derived.pm.
                           This will work in TK8.0 but hopefully something
                           will be implemented to take its place.

                           NOTE : As of Tk-800.015 (Thanks, Nick) this class
                           is deprecated. Some modules may still use this
                           internally but they will gradually be weaned from
                           it at which time it will disappear silently.

Bugs, suggestions, fixes, etc. can either be sent to ptk@lists.stanford.edu
or directly to myself at dkw@rcm.bm. All critiques are welcome.
